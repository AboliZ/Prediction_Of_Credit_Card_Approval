# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Overview:
This repository comprises SQL queries, a normalization file, datasets, and a Colab notebook for credit card approval prediction using machine learning.

## Objective:
The primary aim is to predict credit card approvals based on historical application data by leveraging SQL queries for data extraction, normalization for data preparation, and a machine learning model in a Colab notebook for prediction.

## Contents:
- **SQL Queries**: SQL scripts used to extract and preprocess the initial dataset.
- **Normalization File**: File or documentation detailing the normalization process applied to the dataset.
- **Datasets**: Contains the historical credit card application data.
- **Colab Notebook**: Jupyter notebook in Colab showcasing the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Methodology:
- **SQL Queries**: Used for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Normalization**: Process documentation or file illustrating how the data was normalized for analysis.
- **Dataset Exploration**: Detailed insights into the provided dataset.
- **Colab Notebook**: Comprehensive analysis, data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Getting Started:
1. Use the SQL queries to extract the initial dataset.
2. Refer to the normalization file for details on how the data was processed.
3. Access the datasets for exploration and analysis.
4. Follow the Colab notebook for an in-depth walkthrough of data preprocessing, model development, and predictions.
